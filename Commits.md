## How to commit

### Commits

Please follow the following format when creating commits:

- `feat: adds new feature`
- `fix: fixes bug`
- `docs: add documentation`
- `chore: routine tasks`
  
  A brief explanation of the format types:

- `feat`: new feature that adds functionality.
- `fix`: a fix to an existing feature.
- `docs`: changes to docs or new docs.
- `chore`: changes to code that is neither a fix nor a feature (e.g. refactoring, adding tests, etc.).
